== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* WooCommerce 2.6.10 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of linksync eParcel for WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “linksync eParcel for WooCommerce” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).



== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Will linksync eParcel calculate shipping charges for customer orders on Checkout? =
No, our eParcel solution is only intended to manage orders with eParcel once an order is received. You’ll still need your own solution for charging shipping for orders on checkout.

= Can I use my existing Shipping Methods? =
Yes, we can apply eParcel shipping to your existing shipping options.

= Does linksync eParcel for WooCommerce validate delivery addresses? =
Yes, all orders associated with eParcel shipping are validated against the Australia Post postcode database. If an address fails validation it’s flagged against the order so that site administrators are notified. A consignment can only be allocated to an order with a valid delivery address.

Now, because we validate orders as they are created, when you first install linksync eParcel, existing orders won’t have been validated, so they’ll all show as invalid.

Don’t be alarmed by this – its normal. You just need to view each order, and if the address passes validation, you can simply refresh your page, and move forward with creating your consignments. If the address is invalid, you just need to correct it, and we’ll revalidate it when you save.

= How does linksync WooCommerce eParcel work? =
With linksync for eParcel and WooCommerce, we generate consignment and article numbers for you, create labels, produce manifest summaries, notify your customers of tracking information and more, then when you’re ready to despatch you manifest, we upload it to the Australia Post eParcel SFTP server on your behalf.

Once you sign-up for linksync for eParcel and WooCommerce, and install the linksync WooCommerce eParcel extension, you can start managing your eParcel consignments from within WooCommerce.

All configuration options are managed from within WooCommerce using the Admin Settings for linksync eParcel for WooCommerce, including your eParcel account number, eParcel shipping options, confirmation email details sent to users when orders ship, and other options.


= Do I need to do a manual sync to get inventory for orders? =
No, you don’t. linksync automatically syncs your orders and products.

= What sort of customer service and support can I expect from linksync? =
Glad you asked. We provide support via chat, phone and email, and every person working at linksync is committed to providing first-rate customer service, so we’ll do what everything in our earthly powers to answer any questions or resolve any issues you might have.
